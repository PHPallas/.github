# Hi, Welcome to PHPallas Home ðŸ‘‹

## Our Versioning Strategy And Support

All packages versioning follows the below model:

```
{
  version: "$major.$minor.$release"
}
```

* `$major`: represents main version of the package. Changes in major version indicates on important changes in the program includes inconsistent updates.
* `$minor`: represents sub version of the packages. Changes in minor version indicates on new features added to previous minor released.
* `$release`: represents release number of the package. Changes in release version indicates on bugfix and security updates.

**AFTER THE FIRST RELEASE, EACH MINOR VERSION IS ACTIVELY SUPPORTED FOR A DURATION OF 24 MONTHS. AFTER THE END OF ACTIVELY SUPPORT DURATION, EACH MINOR VERSION IS SUPPORTED FOR AN EXTRA 24 MONTHS FOR CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATES.**

**EACH MAJOR VERSION IS SUPPORTED AS LONG AS THE LAST CORRESPONDING MINOR IS SUPPORTED**

## Current Minimum PHP version: 8.1

While our packages might work well on old versions of PHP, we are not responsible for bugs might occur on depreacated PHP versions. The minimum PHP version that we support is exactly the minimum PHP version supported by the PHP Group.
